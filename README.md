    - cursor-based pagination


## Main technologies introduced

### [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)

The thing itself.

### [Expo](https://expo.dev/)

Eases development with React Native.

### [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

An IDE for Android app development. Important for React Native
development is the ability to emulate Android devices. However,
Expo Go can also be possibly used.

### [Formik](https://formik.org/)

For building forms in React (Native) more easily.

### [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)

Another option for validating objects.

### [AsyncStorage](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/)

localStorage-like for React Native development.

### [Expo SecureStore](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/securestore/)

Encrypted localStorage-like.

### [React Native Test Library](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/)

As it says on the tin.

### [jest-native](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-native)

Adds React Native -specific matchers to Jest.

### [use-debounce](https://github.com/xnimorz/use-debounce)
